          The code calculates two types of integrals (Lebesgue and Riemann integrals) for different mathematical functions and displays the results in a web page. Normal Distribution Function: The first function calculates the value of a normal distribution at any given point. The normal distribution is a common probability distribution that describes many natural phenomena. Quadratic Function: The second function calculates the square of a number (e.g., x^2). Sine Function: The third function calculates the sine of a number, which is a trigonometric function often used in physics and engineering. Lebesgue Integral: This is a way to calculate the area under the curve of a function by dividing the area into small pieces and adding them up. The smaller the pieces, the more accurate the result. Riemann Integral: This is another way to calculate the area under the curve. It's similar to the Lebesgue integral but uses a slightly different approach to break down the area. The code runs these functions over a specific range of values and calculates the two types of integrals for each function. Then, it formats the results nicely and displays them in a paragraph on the web page. The results include the value of the integrals, formatted to a precise number of decimal places.

            General Concept of Sampling Mean and Variance and Main Features of
            Their Distributions
          </h1>
          <p>
            The sampling mean and variance are fundamental concepts in
            statistics that provide insight into the characteristics of a
            dataset drawn from a population. The sampling mean is the average of
            the observed values in a sample, serving as an unbiased estimator of
            the population mean under random sampling. The sampling variance
            quantifies the spread of the data in the sample, representing the
            variability of observations around the sampling mean. Importantly,
            when samples are independently and identically distributed, the
            sampling distribution of the mean approximates a normal distribution
            as sample size increases, as described by the Central Limit Theorem.
            This property underpins many statistical methods and ensures
            reliable inference, with smaller variance for larger samples,
            highlighting the trade-off between precision and sample size.

              General Idea of Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration and Applications to
              Probability and Measure Theory
            </h1>
            The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral generalizes the Riemann integral,
            extending its applicability to more complex functions and measures.
            It is defined with respect to a non-decreasing function, allowing
            integration in terms of arbitrary measures rather than just length
            or volume. In probability theory, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is
            used to define expectations of random variables concerning
            cumulative distribution functions, accommodating both discrete and
            continuous distributions. In measure theory, it serves as a
            cornerstone for unifying different notions of integration, enabling
            the treatment of singular and mixed measures. This versatility makes
            it a powerful tool for rigorous mathematical analysis across
            disciplines such as stochastic processes, functional analysis, and
            financial mathematics.
