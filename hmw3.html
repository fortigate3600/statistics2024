          <h2>Median as the Minimum of the Sum of Absolute Deviations</h2>
          <p>
            To illustrate why the median minimizes the sum of absolute
            deviations, let’s consider a set of data points
            <em>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub></em> where
            <em>x<sub>1</sub> ≤ x<sub>2</sub> ≤ ... ≤ x<sub>n</sub></em
            >. The goal is to find a value <em>c</em> that minimizes the sum of
            absolute deviations:
          </p>

          <pre>
                      S(c) = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> |x<sub>i</sub> - c|
    </pre>

          <p>
            The sum of absolute deviations measures how far each data point
            <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> is from a central value <em>c</em>. To find
            the value of <em>c</em> that minimizes this sum, we need to consider
            how <em>S(c)</em> behaves as <em>c</em> changes.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              When <em>c</em> is less than <em>x<sub>1</sub></em
              >, all terms in the sum <em>|x<sub>i</sub> - c|</em> are
              decreasing as <em>c</em> increases, but the decrease in the sum
              slows down as we approach the median.
            </li>
            <li>
              When <em>c</em> is greater than <em>x<sub>n</sub></em
              >, all terms in the sum <em>|x<sub>i</sub> - c|</em> are
              increasing as <em>c</em> increases, but the increase in the sum
              slows down as we move further from the median.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the value of <em>c</em> that is the median, the sum of
              deviations is minimized because this point balances the number of
              terms on either side, leading to the smallest possible sum of
              absolute distances.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Mathematically, the median <em>c</em> is the value that satisfies
            the condition where the number of points less than or equal to
            <em>c</em> is at least as large as the number of points greater than
            or equal to <em>c</em>. This minimizes the total distance, hence
            making the median the optimal location statistic in terms of
            minimizing absolute deviations.

          <h2>Different Conceptual Definitions of a "Location" Statistic</h2>
          <p>
            A "location" statistic (also called a "center" or "central
            tendency") is a measure that characterizes the center of a
            distribution. There are several ways to define such a statistic,
            each capturing different aspects of the data's central position. The
            generalization of these ideas can lead to a vast number of different
            definitions. Here are a few conceptual definitions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mean (Arithmetic Average): The arithmetic mean is the sum of all
                values divided by the number of values. It represents the
                "balance point" of the distribution, where the sum of the
                deviations from the mean is zero. The mean is sensitive to
                extreme values (outliers) and works well for symmetric, normally
                distributed data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Median (Middle Value): The median is the middle value when the
                data is ordered. It represents the point that divides the data
                into two equal parts. The median is robust to outliers because
                it is only dependent on the order of the data, not the values
                themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mode (Most Frequent Value): The mode is the value that occurs
                most frequently in the dataset. It is useful in describing
                distributions with distinct peaks or multiple clusters. For
                multimodal distributions, there can be multiple modes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trimean: The trimean is a weighted average of the median and the
                midrange (the average of the minimum and maximum values). It
                combines aspects of both the center and the spread of the data,
                providing a more robust location measure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Geometric Mean: The geometric mean is the nth root of the
                product of all values. It is often used for data with
                exponential growth or when values are multiplied together (e.g.,
                in financial or population growth data). It emphasizes the
                central tendency in multiplicative processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Harmonic Mean: The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the
                arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data points. It is
                useful when the data represents rates or ratios and can give a
                better measure of centrality in certain situations (e.g.,
                average speed).
              </li>
              <li>
                Weighted Mean: The weighted mean is a mean where each data point
                is given a weight, indicating its importance. It generalizes the
                arithmetic mean by allowing different data points to contribute
                differently to the central value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quantiles and Percentiles: Quantiles divide the data into equal
                parts, and percentiles specify the value below which a given
                percentage of observations fall. These statistics generalize the
                concept of the median, providing more nuanced measures of
                centrality and spread.
              </li>
              <li>
                M-estimators: These are a general class of location estimators
                that minimize a function of the deviations of the data points.
                The choice of the function (e.g., absolute deviations, squared
                deviations, or others) leads to different types of location
                statistics, such as the median (absolute deviation) or the mean
                (squared deviation).
              </li>
              <li>
                Robust Location Measures: These are defined to minimize the
                effect of outliers. Examples include the median, the trimmed
                mean (where a certain percentage of extreme values are removed),
                and the Hampel identifier. These are often used when the data
                contains outliers that could distort other location statistics.
              </li>
