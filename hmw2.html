        <h1>Behavior of the Mean and Variance Over Time</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <section>
          <p>
            The behavior of the mean and variance over time exhibits several
            interesting characteristics. In a series of repeated experiments or
            trials, the mean tends to stabilize around a constant value. This
            becomes particularly evident as the number of trials increases. As
            we increase the number of trials, the sample mean approaches the
            expected theoretical mean. On the other hand, the variance tends to
            decrease as the number of trials grows. Initially, when only a few
            trials are performed, the observations may vary significantly,
            leading to a higher variance. However, as more data is collected,
            the variance reduces, indicating that the observations are becoming
            increasingly concentrated around the mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this context, it is important to note that, in independent
            trials, the mean remains stable while the variance tends to
            decrease. This implies that although the mean does not change, the
            uncertainty associated with the results decreases as the number of
            trials increases. As a result, the precision of the estimates
            improves with more data, which is a fundamental principle in
            statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reduction in variance over time is a key aspect of the law of
            large numbers. This law asserts that as the number of trials grows,
            the sample mean converges to the true population mean, and the
            variability around this mean decreases. Essentially, the more trials
            conducted, the more accurate and reliable the estimation of the
            population mean becomes.

          Differences Between the Absolute Number of Successes and Relative
          Frequencies Distributions
        </h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <section>
          <p>
            The differences between the distribution of the absolute number of
            successes and that of relative frequencies are also significant. The
            distribution of the absolute number of successes represents the
            total number of successes obtained over a certain number of trials.
            Its variability depends on the total number of trials and the
            probability of success in each trial. For instance, consider an
            experiment with a success probability of 70%. The absolute number of
            successes can vary greatly from one experiment to another unless a
            large number of trials is conducted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, relative frequencies represent the proportion of
            successes relative to the total number of trials, and they tend to
            stabilize more quickly compared to the distribution of the absolute
            number of successes. This occurs because, as mentioned earlier, the
            mean of the relative frequencies approaches the theoretical
            probability of success with an increasing number of trials.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key aspect of this distinction is the asymptotic behavior: while
            the distribution of the absolute number of successes can exhibit
            considerable variability, the distribution of relative frequencies
            tends to converge toward the expected value, which is the
            probability of success. This phenomenon is described by the Central
            Limit Theorem, which states that the sum (or mean) of a large number
            of independent random variables tends to follow a normal
            distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the trials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental result in statistics,
            providing a foundation for making inferences about populations based
            on sample data. It explains why, with a sufficient number of trials,
            the distribution of relative frequencies will approach the true
            probability of success, making statistical predictions more reliable
            as the sample size increases.
