        <h1>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h1>

            The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a cornerstone of mathematical
            analysis, establishing a profound connection between the concepts of
            differentiation and integration. It provides the theoretical
            foundation for integral calculus and plays a critical role in a wide
            variety of mathematical and applied fields. The theorem consists of
            two key parts. The first part asserts that the definite integral of
            a continuous function 𝑓(𝑥) over a closed interval [𝑎, 𝑏] can be
            computed using an antiderivative 𝐹(𝑥) of the function 𝑓(𝑥).
            Specifically, it states that:
            <code>∫ₐᵇ 𝑓(𝑥) dx = 𝐹(𝑏) − 𝐹(𝑎)</code>. This means that the integral
            of 𝑓(𝑥) can be evaluated by finding the difference between the
            values of its antiderivative 𝐹(𝑥) at the boundaries of the interval.
            The second part of the theorem establishes that if 𝐹(𝑥) is defined
            as the integral of 𝑓(𝑥) from a fixed point 𝑎, then the derivative of
            𝐹(𝑥) with respect to 𝑥 is equal to the function 𝑓(𝑥), i.e.,
            <code>𝐹′(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥)</code>. This shows the reverse relationship
            between differentiation and integration, providing a solid link
            between the two concepts.

            The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not only foundational to pure
            mathematics but also has significant applications in various
            scientific disciplines, including probability theory. In the context
            of probability, it helps define the relationship between the
            probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution
            function (CDF). Specifically, if we have a continuous random
            variable 𝑋 with a probability density function 𝑓(𝑥), the cumulative
            distribution function 𝐹(𝑥) gives the probability that the random
            variable 𝑋 takes a value less than or equal to a specific value 𝑥.
            This is expressed mathematically as:
            <code>𝐹(𝑥) = 𝑃(𝑋 ≤ 𝑥) = ∫₋∞ˣ 𝑓(𝑡) dt</code>. In this framework, the
            Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies that the derivative of the
            CDF 𝐹(𝑥) with respect to 𝑥 is equal to the PDF 𝑓(𝑥). That is,
            <code>𝐹′(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥)</code>. This relationship shows how the PDF
            represents the local "density" of probability at each point, while
            the CDF accumulates this density along the entire range of values
            that 𝑋 can take. Essentially, the CDF gives the cumulative
            probability up to a certain point, while the PDF describes how this
            probability is distributed across different values of 𝑋. The
            Fundamental Theorem, in this case, helps bridge the connection
            between the two functions and provides a deeper understanding of the
            underlying distribution of the random variable.
